# .500SW Lever Action Rifle 
A minimod of a mod of a mod for Doom.

Lever-action rifles have come back into popularity of a sort thanks to their ease-of-use and ability to utilize handgun-caliber ammo better than a smaller gun. This one's specially chambered in .500 S&W, with a distinctive forest green stock and grip to differentiate it from other similar rifles. The gun hits like a truck, too, and works especially well on demons up to and including hell knights. That said, the gun's not quite stable enough to handle hand-loaded ammunition well, and as such only loads regular ammo.

You can use the loadout code "W50" to spawn with one, and "scope" puts a modified liberator scope on it.

Requires Hideous Destructor, and the BulletLib addon for it.
