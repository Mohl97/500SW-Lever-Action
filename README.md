# .500SW Scoped Lever Action Rifle 
A minimod of a mod of a mod for Doom.


Seriously, it's just a scoped version of the lever action rifle from Potetobloke's pack, rechambered in .500 S&W for extra ouch.
It's been cleaned up to be compatible with the original, too.
The loadout code is **LR2**. I might change this once I think of a better name, might also recolor the thing to look a little different as well.

The sprites and vast majority of code are from Potetobloke's pack, with very minor edits to the size of the scope, and the scope functionality is ripped directly from the liberator rifle.

Requires Hideous Destructor, and the BulletLib addon for it.
